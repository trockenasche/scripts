### [backupcleanup.sh](backupcleanup.sh)

With all SAP databases, the logs are automatically saved on the backup target. However, these must be tidied up, otherwise they will cause the backup target to overflow.
For this purpose, there is a cron job on each database server under the SIDadm.
A script is called up via this job which then deletes the logs that are older than the specified days.
The days are counted backwards to the last most recent log file.<br>
Example: `.\backupcleanup.sh --SID SAP --days 7`
